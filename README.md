**LLM Application - Comprehensive Deployment and CI/CD Pipeline**
**Overview**
This repository hosts a Large Language Model (LLM) Application designed with a robust infrastructure encompassing automated CI/CD pipelines, multi-cloud deployment strategies, observability integrations, and reliable rollback mechanisms.

**Features**
Automated CI/CD Pipeline: Utilizes GitHub Actions for seamless integration and delivery.

Comprehensive Testing: Includes unit, integration, and end-to-end test suites.

Observability: Integrated with Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization.

Multi-Cloud Deployment: Deploys across AWS and GCP/Azure regions to ensure high availability.

Rollback Strategy: Implements automated and manual rollback procedures with detailed logging.

**Requirements**
Software & Tools
Python 3.7 or higher: For running the application.

Docker: For containerization.

Kubernetes: For orchestration (kubectl, kustomize).

Terraform: For infrastructure provisioning.

Prometheus & Grafana: For monitoring and visualization.

GitHub Actions: For CI/CD automation.

Cloud Services
AWS and GCP/Azure Accounts: For multi-cloud deployment.

Managed Kubernetes Clusters: EKS (AWS), GKE (GCP), or AKS (Azure).

Cloud Storage: S3 (AWS), GCS (GCP), or Blob Storage (Azure) for storing assets and logs.
**Environment Variables**
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following variables:
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_huggingface_api_key
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_access_key
GCP_PROJECT_ID=your_gcp_project_id
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=your_azure_subscription_id
KUBECONFIG=path_to_your_kubeconfig_file
PROMETHEUS_URL=http://your_prometheus_server
GRAFANA_URL=http://your_grafana_server
**CI/CD Pipeline**
The CI/CD pipeline is orchestrated using GitHub Actions and comprises the following stages:

Code Quality Checks: Linting and static analysis.

Testing: Execution of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

Containerization: Building Docker images of the application.

Deployment: Applying Kubernetes manifests to deploy the application.

Monitoring Setup: Configuring Prometheus and Grafana for observability.

Rollback Mechanism: Automated rollback on deployment failures.

**Multi-Cloud Deployment**
The application is deployed across AWS and GCP/Azure regions to ensure redundancy and high availability. Deployment is managed using:

Terraform: For provisioning cloud resources.

Kubernetes: For deploying and managing application containers.

Kustomize: For environment-specific configurations.

Load balancing and failover strategies are implemented to distribute traffic and handle regional outages effectively.

**Observability**
Monitoring and observability are achieved through:

Prometheus: Collects real-time metrics from the application and infrastructure.

Grafana: Provides dashboards for visualizing metrics and system performance.

Alerting: Configured to notify the team of any anomalies or critical issues.

Deployment Steps
Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed and configured:

1.Docker

2.Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)

3.Kustomize

4.Terraform

5.Prometheus & Grafana
**Process**
1.Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/Jadavivek/llm-application1.git
cd llm-application1
2.Set Up Environment Variables:
cp .env.example .env
3.Initialize Terraform:
cd deployment/terraform
terraform init
4.Apply Terraform Configurations:
terraform apply
5.Deploy to Kubernetes:
kubectl apply -k deployment/kubernetes/overlays/production
6.Verify Deployment:
kubectl get pods
kubectl logs <pod-name>

**Rollback Strategy**
In case of deployment failures:

Automated Rollback: The CI/CD pipeline detects failures and reverts to the previous stable state.

Manual Rollback: Execute the following command:
